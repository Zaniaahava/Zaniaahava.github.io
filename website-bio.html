            <p> Born and raised in Charleston SC, Zania Ahava is an Actor, Poet and Creative 
                based in NYC. She recieved her classical training at The American Academy of Dramtic
                Arts where she recieved the James Fisher award. While studying in New York she rediscovered
                her love of poetry and has been performing as a spoken word artists for 3 years.
                As a creative she uses poetry and acting intersectionally, often divising pieces about self love
                self worth and the feeling of otherness in society. Her art is unapologetic af! She uses  her own Journey through "womanhood" as a catalyst to inspire
                through poetry. A proud believer of activism through art. </br>
                Because Art is just a reflection of the world we see, it should be just like the world everchanging. It should be bold, and even scary
                thats what makes a piece beautful when you've found a way to communicate a realness.
